# Overview

This is the source code for the Core Hunter project <http://corehunter.org>

Core Hunter is a library for selecting and analysing genetic
resources.  The source code is currently organized into a libary, and
a two command line interface (CLI) applciations using the library.

Core Hunter library:
./corehunter-lib/*

Core Hunter CLI application:
./corehunter-cli/*

Core Analyser CLI application:
./coreanalyser-cli/*


# Building the source

The project currently required Maven, and any JDK version 1.5+.

On a unix/linux flavoured OS:

    ./build.sh

On windows:

    mvn package

The former simply copies the resulting JAR files into a bin directory of the project.


# An example of running the CoreHunter CLI application

Assuming CoreHunter was built with `build.sh`:

    java -jar bin/corehunter-cli.jar -MR 0.7 -SH 0.3 data/examples/bul.csv mycoresubset.dat
